Hello. 
I am Ilias Shaikh. Currently working as a development manager in London, but always programmer by craft and at heart. In my day job I work on the microsoft stack, programming, writing, designing and overseeing development in C#. I am however interested in all aspects of programming and love reading up on and learning new technologies.
